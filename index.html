        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
        <h3 class="orange">www.elihome.org</h3>
        <p>People are less likely to donate to a website that doesn’t look professional and has unclear impacts made by donations. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="solution">
        <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>By improving the website flow, focusing content, and creating a cohesive design, it will make the nonprofit appear professional; therefore, improve donation conversion, as well as, build a larger support base.</p>

        <h4 class="teal">Redlining</h4>
        <p>In the <b> heuristic evaluation</b> of <a href="https://elihome.org/">www.elihome.org</a>, it was clear that there was no consistent design and the choice of text didn’t present the nonprofit as professional. The hero images were varied in size so it didn’t fit the allotted boundary properly. The content was easy to scan but some pages had lengthy paragraphs. 
        <br>
        The logo in the header navigation took up way too much space and categories were broken into two lines depending on screen size.  On the mobile screen ,the search icon disappeared completely. There was one broken social media links and one social media selection that didn’t serve any purpose nor was it related to the message of Eli Home. </p>

        <h4 class="teal">Collecting the Data</h4>
        <p>A <b> competitive analysis </b>of other organizations indicated that it is necessary for Eli Home to overhaul their website to have a good online presence and improve credibility. Good design and the first impression really matters. The message needs to be clear and needs of the organization evident. 
        <br>
        Upon <b> interviewing </b>Lorri Galloway, the Executive Director, it was indicated that the donations typically raised from hosting quarterly events were non-existent due to Covid-19. They were having a difficult time adjusting so they had to rely on their discount store and online home products store to generate funds to continue their programs. They, more than ever, needed their website to attract donors by showcasing the work they do.
        <br>   
        The <b> user testing </b>and <b> survey </b>provided additional information which were compiled in an <b> affinity diagram</b> to gain key insights. </p>
